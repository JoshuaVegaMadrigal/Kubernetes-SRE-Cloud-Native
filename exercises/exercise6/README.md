### ArgoCD Architecture

- [ArgoCD Architecture](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/architecture/) - Official architecture documentation

### Key Concepts You'll Learn

**GitOps Benefits** include declarative infrastructure that prevents configuration drift, Git-based audit trails for all deployment changes, automated synchronization between Git state and cluster state, and clear separation between application development and deployment operations.

**ArgoCD Components** consist of the API Server that provides the web UI and gRPC API, the Repository Server that maintains cached copies of Git repositories, the Application Controller that monitors applications and synchronizes cluster state, and the Dex component that provides authentication integration.

**Deployment Automation** through ArgoCD continuously monitors Git repositories for changes, compares desired state with actual cluster state, automatically applies configuration changes, and provides real-time visibility into deployment status and application health.

---

## Understanding GitOps for Deployment Management

Your current deployment approach from previous exercises relies on manual kubectl commands for deployment management. This creates operational challenges including potential configuration drift, manual change tracking, limited deployment history, and imperative deployment processes that can create inconsistent state.

### Current State vs GitOps Target

**Current Manual Process** requires direct cluster access for deployments, uses imperative commands that modify cluster state directly, provides limited deployment history and audit trails, and relies on human intervention for deployment coordination and rollback procedures.

**GitOps Target State** uses Git repositories as the single source of truth for deployment configuration. ArgoCD continuously monitors Git for changes and automatically applies updates, maintains complete deployment history through Git commits, and provides automated synchronization with clear visibility into deployment status.

### Why GitOps Matters for Operations

**Improved Deployment Reliability** through declarative configuration that ensures consistent deployment state across environments. **Enhanced Change Management** through Git-based approval workflows, complete audit trails, and rollback capabilities. **Reduced Operational Overhead** through automation of manual deployment processes and elimination of configuration drift.

---

## Setting Up ArgoCD for Automated Deployments

### Preparing the GitOps Engine

ArgoCD serves as the automation engine that continuously synchronizes your desired deployment state (stored in Git) with your actual cluster state. This section guides you through deploying ArgoCD with production-ready configuration.

### Step 1: Navigate to Exercise Environment and Deploy ArgoCD

Set up your working directory and install ArgoCD:

```bash
# Navigate to Exercise 6 directory
cd exercises/exercise6
```

```bash
# Install ArgoCD using provided automation
chmod +x scripts/setup-argocd.sh
./scripts/setup-argocd.sh
```

**Expected output:**
```
[SUCCESS] ArgoCD installation manifest applied
[INFO] Configuring LoadBalancer access...
service/argocd-server-lb created
[SUCCESS] LoadBalancer service configured
[INFO] Waiting for ArgoCD components to be ready...
deployment.apps/argocd-server condition met
deployment.apps/argocd-repo-server condition met
deployment.apps/argocd-dex-server condition met
deployment.apps/argocd-applicationset-controller condition met
[SUCCESS] ArgoCD components are ready
[INFO] Waiting for LoadBalancer IP assignment...
[SUCCESS] LoadBalancer IP assigned: 34.31.169.228
ARGOCD_IP=34.31.169.228
[INFO] Retrieving initial admin password...
[SUCCESS] Initial admin password retrieved
ARGOCD_PASSWORD=5yK1I0fkL2HyrsxV
[INFO] ArgoCD installation completed!

======================================================
           ArgoCD Access Information
======================================================
URL: https://34.31.169.228
Username: admin
Password: PASSWORD

Note: Accept the self-signed certificate in your browser
======================================================
```

ArgoCD deployment takes 3-5 minutes. Wait until all pods show `Running` status before proceeding.

```bash
# Monitor ArgoCD deployment
kubectl get pods -n argocd
```

**Expected output:**

```
NAME                                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
argocd-application-controller-0                    1/1     Running   0          79s
argocd-applicationset-controller-5b75d899b-lb7n8   1/1     Running   0          64s
argocd-dex-server-59746c9588-cwkcg                 1/1     Running   0          63s
argocd-notifications-controller-5f96c56f77-s9ms7   1/1     Running   0          20m
argocd-redis-56f98f7cd8-xv7gw                      1/1     Running   0          20m
argocd-repo-server-546fb64cd4-zd4rc                1/1     Running   0          20m
argocd-server-79b5565d68-fqljf                     1/1     Running   0          20m
```

**Access the ArgoCD web interface** using the URL from your output (accept the self-signed certificate). The interface provides visual representation of applications, deployment status, and synchronization history.

**Test web interface access:**
- Navigate to the ARGOCD_IP URL from your terminal output
- Accept the self-signed certificate when prompted by your browser
- Login with username `admin` and the password from your terminal output
- Verify you can see the ArgoCD dashboard (should be empty initially)

### Step 2: Install and Configure ArgoCD CLI

Set up command-line access for ArgoCD management:

```bash
# Install ArgoCD CLI
curl -sSL -o argocd-linux-amd64 https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/latest/download/argocd-linux-amd64
sudo install -m 555 argocd-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/argocd
rm argocd-linux-amd64
```

```bash
# Login to ArgoCD
argocd login $ARGOCD_IP --username admin --password $ARGOCD_PASSWORD --insecure
```

**Expected output:**
```
'admin:login' logged in successfully
Context '$ARGOCD_IP' updated
```

**Note**: If you get ArgoCD CLI help text instead of a successful login, the environment variables may have been cleared. Re-export them:

```bash
# Re-export ArgoCD credentials if needed
export ARGOCD_IP=$(kubectl get service argocd-server-lb -n argocd -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')
export ARGOCD_PASSWORD=$(kubectl -n argocd get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 -d)
```

```bash
# Then retry the login
argocd login $ARGOCD_IP --username admin --password $ARGOCD_PASSWORD --insecure
```

## Implementing GitOps Deployment Pipelines

### Connecting Git State to Cluster Deployments

This section establishes the GitOps deployment pipeline that connects your application configuration in Git to automated cluster deployments through ArgoCD.

### Step 3: Configure GitOps Repository Structure

Examine and understand the GitOps deployment configuration:

```bash
# Examine the ArgoCD deployment
cat k8s/gitops/deployment.yaml
```

```bash
# Examine the ArgoCD application configuration
cat k8s/argocd/application.yaml
```

**Understanding GitOps structure:** The `k8s/gitops/` directory contains declarative Kubernetes manifests that define your application's desired state. ArgoCD monitors this directory and automatically applies changes when manifests are updated.

**Key GitOps principles implemented:**
- **Declarative Configuration**: All deployment state defined in version-controlled YAML
- **Git as Source of Truth**: Changes must go through Git workflows
- **Automated Synchronization**: ArgoCD applies changes without manual intervention
- **Complete Auditability**: All changes tracked through Git commit history

### Step 4: Create ArgoCD Application

Configure ArgoCD to manage your demo application:

**Important:** Before applying the ArgoCD application, update the repository URL to match your GitHub repository.

**Edit `k8s/argocd/application.yaml` line 16:**

```yaml
# CURRENT:
repoURL: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/kubernetes-sre-cloud-native

# SHOULD BE (replace with your actual GitHub username):
repoURL: https://github.com/your-actual-username/kubernetes-sre-cloud-native
```

**Also update the container image reference in `k8s/gitops/deployment.yaml` line 38:**

```yaml
# CURRENT:
image: gcr.io/PROJECT_ID/sre-demo-app:latest

# SHOULD BE (replace with your actual registry path from previous exercises):
image: us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/your-project-id/sre-demo-app/sre-demo-app:latest
```

Apply the ArgoCD application configuration:

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/argocd/application.yaml
```

**Expected output:**
```
application.argoproj.io/sre-demo-gitops created
```

Verify application creation:

```bash
argocd app get sre-demo-gitops
```

**Expected output:**
```
Name:               argocd/sre-demo-gitops
Project:            default
Server:             https://kubernetes.default.svc
Namespace:          default
URL:                https://34.63.232.153/applications/sre-demo-gitops
Repo:               https://github.com/rsergio07/kubernetes-sre-cloud-native
Target:             main
Path:               exercises/exercise6/k8s/gitops
SyncWindow:         Sync Allowed
Sync Policy:        Automated (Prune)
Sync Status:        Synced to main (f0fe984)
Health Status:      Healthy

GROUP  KIND        NAMESPACE  NAME               STATUS  HEALTH   HOOK  MESSAGE
       Service     default    sre-demo-service   Synced  Healthy        service/sre-demo-service unchanged
       Service     default    sre-demo-headless  Synced  Healthy        service/sre-demo-headless unchanged
apps   Deployment  default    sre-demo-app       Synced  Healthy        deployment.apps/sre-demo-app configured          
```

**Access the ArgoCD application view:** Navigate to the URL shown in the `argocd app get` output (e.g., `https://ARGOCD_IP/applications/sre-demo-gitops`).

---

## Exploring ArgoCD Operations

### Understanding GitOps Through ArgoCD Interface

This section focuses on understanding GitOps operations through direct interaction with ArgoCD, demonstrating how declarative configuration management works in practice.

### Step 5: Explore ArgoCD Interface and Concepts

**Navigate to your ArgoCD application** and explore the interface:

**Application Overview**: View sync status, health indicators, and resource hierarchy to understand how ArgoCD visualizes your application state.

**Resource Tree**: Examine how ArgoCD displays the relationships between Kubernetes resources (Deployment → ReplicaSet → Pods → Services).

**Sync Controls**: Understand the difference between manual and automatic synchronization options available in the interface.

**History Tab**: Review deployment history and previous configurations to see how GitOps maintains change tracking.

Practice ArgoCD operations using CLI:

```bash
# View current application status
argocd app get sre-demo-gitops
```

```bash
# Trigger manual sync to ensure latest state
argocd app sync sre-demo-gitops
```

```bash
# Check sync history
argocd app history sre-demo-gitops
```

```bash
# View application details in YAML format
argocd app get sre-demo-gitops -o yaml
```

**Understanding ArgoCD Application Status:**

The ArgoCD interface shows your GitOps deployment in action. Key status indicators you'll observe:

**Sync Status Progression:**
- **OutOfSync**: ArgoCD detects differences between Git and cluster state
- **Sync OK**: Git state matches cluster state successfully
- **Progressing**: Kubernetes resources are being created/updated
- **Healthy**: All resources are running and ready

**Resource Tree View** displays your application components:
- **Deployment**: Your application pods with replica management
- **Services**: Network access and service discovery
- **Individual Pods**: Each pod instance with age and status indicators

---

## Testing GitOps Configuration Management

### Experimenting with Declarative Configuration Changes

This section demonstrates the core GitOps workflow by making controlled configuration changes and observing how ArgoCD automatically applies them to your cluster.

### Step 6: Test GitOps Workflow with Configuration Changes

#### 1. Check Current Application State

Before making configuration changes, examine the current state of your application to understand the baseline:

```bash
# Check current deployment configuration
kubectl get deployment sre-demo-app -o yaml | grep -A 5 "replicas\|image:"
```

**Expected output:**

```
  labels:
    app: sre-demo-app
    component: backend
--
  replicas: 2
  revisionHistoryLimit: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: sre-demo-app
  strategy:
--
        image: us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/gcp-sre-lab/sre-demo-app/sre-demo-app:latest
        imagePullPolicy: Always
        livenessProbe:
          failureThreshold: 3
          httpGet:
            path: /health
--
  replicas: 2
  updatedReplicas: 2
```

```bash
# View current pod count and status
kubectl get pods -l app=sre-demo-app
```

**Expected output:**

```
NAME                            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
sre-demo-app-84b5769f44-pqmh8   1/1     Running   0         9m
sre-demo-app-84b5769f44-vvs9z   1/1     Running   7         52m
```

```bash
# Check ArgoCD application current state
argocd app get sre-demo-gitops | grep -A 10 "GROUP.*KIND"
```

**Expected output:**

```
GROUP  KIND        NAMESPACE  NAME               STATUS  HEALTH   HOOK  MESSAGE
       Service     default    sre-demo-service   Synced  Healthy        service/sre-demo-service unchanged
       Service     default    sre-demo-headless  Synced  Healthy        service/sre-demo-headless unchanged
apps   Deployment  default    sre-demo-app       Synced  Healthy        deployment.apps/sre-demo-app configured
```

---

#### 2. Make a Configuration Change

Scale the application to test GitOps synchronization:

```bash
sed -i 's/replicas: 2/replicas: 3/g' k8s/gitops/deployment.yaml
grep "replicas:" k8s/gitops/deployment.yaml
```

**Expected output:**

```
replicas: 3
```

---

#### 3. Commit and Push

```bash
git add k8s/gitops/deployment.yaml
git commit -m "gitops: Scale application to 3 replicas for testing"
git push origin main
```

---

#### 4. Refresh ArgoCD

ArgoCD may take time to detect the new commit. Force a refresh:

**From the CLI:**

```bash
argocd app get sre-demo-gitops --refresh
```

**From the ArgoCD UI:**

1. Open your application.
2. Click **SYNC** and then **SYNCHRONIZE**.
3. The app should now show **3 replicas**.

**From the Terminal:**

```bash
kubectl get pods -l app=sre-demo-app
```

**Expected output:**

```
NAME                            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
sre-demo-app-xyz123             1/1     Running   0          2m
sre-demo-app-xyz456             1/1     Running   0          2m
sre-demo-app-xyz789             1/1     Running   0          1m
```

```bash
kubectl get deployment sre-demo-app
```

**Expected output:**

```
NAME           READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
sre-demo-app   3/3     3            3           2d20h
```

### ⚠️ Note

During your test, the replicas briefly scaled to **3**, but quickly reverted back to **2**.
This happened because the Git repository still declared `replicas: 2` as the desired state.

This behavior illustrates the **GitOps reconciliation loop**: ArgoCD continuously enforces the state defined in Git, overriding any manual or temporary changes in the cluster.

To confirm this behavior in your own environment, run:

```bash
kubectl describe deployment sre-demo-app | tail -10
```

**Expected output:**

```
  ----           ------  ------
  Progressing    True    NewReplicaSetAvailable
  Available      True    MinimumReplicasAvailable
OldReplicaSets:  sre-demo-app-575794657d (0/0 replicas created)
NewReplicaSet:   sre-demo-app-84b5769f44 (2/2 replicas created)
Events:
  Type    Reason             Age                  From                   Message
  ----    ------             ----                 ----                   -------
  Normal  ScalingReplicaSet  6m59s (x2 over 95m)  deployment-controller  Scaled up replica set sre-demo-app-84b5769f44 from 2 to 3
  Normal  ScalingReplicaSet  6m1s (x2 over 94m)   deployment-controller  Scaled down replica set sre-demo-app-84b5769f44 from 3 to 2
```

You’ll see events showing the scale-up to 3 replicas, immediately followed by a scale-down back to 2.

### Key Learning

* **Git as Source of Truth**: Even if you scale manually, ArgoCD reconciles back to the Git-defined state.
* **Forcing Refresh**: Use `--refresh` or the UI **SYNC** button to ensure ArgoCD picks up new commits immediately.
* **Configuration Drift Prevention**: GitOps ensures consistency by detecting and correcting drift automatically.

## Step 7: Test Rollback Using the ArgoCD UI

Now that you’ve seen GitOps reconciliation with scaling changes, let’s explore how ArgoCD handles **rollback** directly in the web interface.

1. **Open your ArgoCD Application** (`sre-demo-gitops`) in the UI.
   You’ll see the resource tree showing Services, Deployment, ReplicaSets, and Pods.

2. **Navigate to the “History and Rollback” tab**.
   This shows the full deployment history ArgoCD has recorded, with each entry tied to a Git commit.

3. **Select a previous revision** in the list.
   (For example, the commit just before your scaling change.)

4. **Click “Rollback”** to redeploy that revision.
   ArgoCD will update your cluster to match the older commit.

⚠️ **Important Note**: The rollback is temporary. Since Git still declares `replicas: 2` in the manifest, ArgoCD will reconcile back to that state. This illustrates the key GitOps principle: **Git is always the single source of truth.**

---

## Step 8: Explore Sync Policies and Manual Control

Next, let’s experiment with ArgoCD’s **sync policies**.

1. In the **ArgoCD Application view**, go to the **App Details** tab.
   Look for the **Sync Policy** section.

2. **Switch the policy from “Automated” to “Manual.”**
   Now ArgoCD will stop automatically applying Git changes.
   The UI will still detect when your cluster is **OutOfSync**, but it won’t enforce reconciliation.

3. **Make a Git change** (for example, add a comment line to `deployment.yaml`) and push it.
   Back in the ArgoCD UI, you’ll see the app status turn **OutOfSync**.

4. Instead of ArgoCD fixing it immediately, you’ll need to:

   * Click **SYNC** → **SYNCHRONIZE** to apply the change manually.

5. **Switch the sync policy back to Automated** when finished, so ArgoCD resumes enforcing Git state automatically.

---

### Key Learning

* **Rollback in the UI** is useful for quick recovery, but not permanent — Git always wins.
* **Sync Policies** give you flexibility:

  * Automated ensures Git is always enforced.
  * Manual gives you control to stage or delay changes.
  * The UI provides full visibility: resource tree, history, rollback, sync, and health — without needing CLI commands.

---

## Final Objective

By completing this exercise, you should be able to demonstrate:

Your application deploys using GitOps principles with ArgoCD managing automated synchronization from Git repositories. You understand how to make declarative configuration changes that ArgoCD automatically detects and applies to your cluster. You can use ArgoCD's interface to monitor deployment status, review deployment history, and perform rollback operations. The complete workflow provides audit trails through Git commits and reduces manual deployment effort through automated synchronization.

### Verification Questions

Test your understanding by answering these questions:

1. **How does** ArgoCD detect when configuration changes are made in Git repositories?

2. **What is** the difference between imperative and declarative deployment management?

3. **Why is** Git-based audit trail valuable for deployment operations and compliance?

4. **How would** you troubleshoot an ArgoCD application that shows "OutOfSync" status?

5. **What are** the benefits of using GitOps compared to direct kubectl deployment commands?

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**ArgoCD not syncing changes from Git**: Check repository access with `argocd app get sre-demo-gitops` and verify that ArgoCD can reach your GitHub repository. Ensure the repository path and branch are correctly configured in the application definition.

**ArgoCD application stuck in OutOfSync**: Check for resource conflicts with `argocd app get sre-demo-gitops -o yaml` and verify that ArgoCD has necessary RBAC permissions for the target namespace. Try manual sync with `argocd app sync sre-demo-gitops`.

**Manual sync required repeatedly**: This is common in development environments like Codespaces due to network latency. Use `argocd app sync sre-demo-gitops` when needed, or switch to manual sync policy for testing.

**Web interface not accessible**: Verify LoadBalancer IP assignment with `kubectl get service argocd-server-lb -n argocd` and ensure firewall rules allow access to the ArgoCD port.

**CLI login issues**: Confirm ArgoCD server is accessible and use the `--insecure` flag for development environments with self-signed certificates.

### Advanced Troubleshooting

**Debugging GitOps sync failures**: Check ArgoCD server logs with `kubectl logs -n argocd deployment/argocd-server` and review application events with `argocd app get sre-demo-gitops --show-events`.

**Repository access issues**: Verify repository URL in application definition and check ArgoCD repository server logs with `kubectl logs -n argocd deployment/argocd-repo-server`.

**Resource sync conflicts**: Use `kubectl get events` to identify resource-level issues and compare desired state in Git with actual cluster state using `kubectl diff`.

## Next Steps

You have successfully implemented GitOps deployment management using ArgoCD for automated Kubernetes deployments. You've established declarative deployment workflows, learned to use ArgoCD's interface for deployment management, tested configuration changes through Git workflows, and experienced the operational benefits of GitOps including audit trails and rollback capabilities.

**Proceed to [Exercise 7](../exercise7/)** where you will implement comprehensive production readiness including security hardening, cost optimization strategies, disaster recovery procedures, and compliance frameworks that build upon your reliable deployment infrastructure.

**Key Concepts to Remember**: GitOps provides declarative, auditable deployment management that reduces human error and improves reliability. ArgoCD serves as the automation engine that continuously synchronizes Git state with cluster state. Git-based workflows provide complete audit trails and enable easy rollback to previous configurations. Automated synchronization eliminates configuration drift and reduces manual deployment effort.

**Before Moving On**: Ensure you can explain how GitOps improves deployment reliability compared to manual processes, how ArgoCD detects and applies configuration changes, and how Git-based workflows provide better audit trails and rollback capabilities than imperative deployment approaches.
